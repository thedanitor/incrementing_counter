# Incrementing Counter

https://thedanitor.github.io/incrementing_counter/

This project is from the Day 15 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have heavily commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what each line of code does.

### Overall Impression

Cool widget to add some life to webpage. Would be cool to make an API call to those accounts to keep the data-target updated in real time. Could also be used for any numeric value on website.

### Things Learned

* Can use getAttribute with data-target to get the value from an element
* Add + in front of string of numbers to change to number
